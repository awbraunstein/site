I'm Andrew and I'm currently roaming the US looking for rocks to climb and
mountains to snowboard.

I also write code and am for hire for freelance/contract work.

In addition to spending time outdoors, I'm also very passionate about
education. I spent 4 years volunteering with
[TEALSK12](https://www.tealsk12.org/) where I taught computer science to Bay
Area high schoolers. I had the opportunity to be exposed to computer science
through my high school and it changed me forever. I aimed to have that same
effect on the students that I taught.
